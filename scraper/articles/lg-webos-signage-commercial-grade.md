LG commercial displays running webOS Signage are common in hotels, restaurants, retail and other businesses. The OptiSigns app runs directly on these displays, so you don't need a separate player.

On LG webOS Signage, OptiSigns saves your content on the display so it keeps playing if the internet drops, starts by itself when the display turns on, and updates itself.

## Choose an Install Method
You can install OptiSigns in two ways:

 
-  **From a USB drive:** the easiest option. You don't need to type a URL with the remote, and you can reuse the same USB drive to set up many displays. 
- From the server: no USB drive needed. You enter the address "https://links.optisigns.com/lg" in the display's SI Server Setting. 
If you have many displays, you can also put the server settings in a file on a USB drive. See **Batch Install with a USB Settings File** below.

---

## Before You Begin
Factory reset the display so it starts from basic settings.

Connect the display to the internet over Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

Set the date, time and time zone. This makes sure your schedules play at the right local time.

---

## Install from a USB Drive
[Download the OptiSigns app for LG webOS Signage](https://links.optisigns.com/lg) (**com.lg.app.signage.ipk**) to your computer.

Format a USB drive as **FAT32** if it isn't already.

Create a folder named **application** in the root of the USB drive, then copy the .ipk file into it.

Insert the USB drive into the display's USB port.

Press the settings (gear) button on the remote, then go to **EZ Setting** > **SI Server Setting**.

Select **SI Server Setting**.

Set **Application Launch Mode** to **Local** and **Application Type** to **IPK**. Then select **Local Application Upgrade** > **USB**.

Select **Confirm** to install the app.

If the USB drive is set up correctly, the display shows **Upgrade Complete**.

Turn the display off, then on again. When it comes back on, it shows that it's upgrading the application.

When the upgrade finishes, it shows **Complete**.

The OptiSigns app opens by itself and shows a pairing code. You can now remove the USB drive.

---

## Install from the Server
Press the settings (gear) button on the remote, then go to **EZ Setting** > **SI Server Setting**.

Select **SI Server Setting**.

Set **Fully Qualified Domain Name** to **On**, then enter `https://links.optisigns.com/lg` in the field below it.

Set **Application Launch Mode** to **Local** and **Application Type** to **IPK**. Then select **Local Application Upgrade** > **REMOTE**.

Select **Confirm** to install the app.

If the address is correct, the display shows **Upgrade Complete**. If it shows an error, check the address for typos and try again.

Turn the display off, then on again. When it comes back on, it shows that it's upgrading the application.

When the upgrade finishes, it shows **Complete**.

The OptiSigns app opens by itself and shows a pairing code.

**Note:** When OptiSigns updates itself, it changes the **Fully Qualified Domain Name** field to the address of the new version. If you see a different OptiSigns address there later, that's expected.

---

## Batch Install with a USB Settings File
Instead of entering the address and settings on each display, you can put them in a file on a USB drive and reuse it.

1. On your computer, create a file named **scap_installation.json** with this content:

```
{"serverIp": "0.0.0.0", "serverPort": 0, "secureConnection": false, "fqdnMode": true, "fqdnAddr": "https://links.optisigns.com/lg", "appLaunchMode": "local", "appType": "ipk"}

```

 
1. Copy the file into the root of the USB drive. 
2. Insert the USB drive into the display, then turn it on or restart it. 
3. When the installation finishes, restart the display. The OptiSigns app starts by itself. 

---

## Pair the Display with Your Account
Go to [app.optisigns.com](https://app.optisigns.com/) and log in. If you don't have an account yet, select **Create Account**. You can also log in with Google, Microsoft or Facebook.

On the **Screens** page, select **Add Screen**.

Enter the pairing code shown on the display in **Pair code**, then select **Pair**.

From now on, the OptiSigns app starts by itself whenever the display turns on.

---

## How Content and Updates Work
 
-  **Offline playback:** OptiSigns downloads your content to the display's storage, so it keeps playing without an internet connection. When the display runs low on space, OptiSigns removes files that are no longer in use. 
-  **Automatic updates:** OptiSigns checks for new versions of its app and installs them on the display. An update needs about 30 MB of free space. 

---

## Check Your Firmware Version
Press the settings (gear) button on the remote, then go to **General** > **System Information**.

---

## Update the LG Firmware
If your display runs webOS 4.1 or older, you may need to update its firmware before OptiSigns apps such as Weather and Social Media can play.

 
1. Get the latest firmware file (.epk) from the [LG partner website](https://partner.lge.com/global/portal/main/main/fowardMenuUrl.lge?_MenuId=210099&_MenuLevel=3&_MenuParentId=210021). For help, see [LG's guide to updating software manually](https://www.lg.com/us/support/help-library/lg-tv-how-to-manually-update-software--20154165668198), or contact us or LG. 
2. Create a folder named **LG_MONITOR** in the root of a USB drive, then copy the .epk file into it. 
3. Insert the USB drive into the display. The update menu appears by itself. 
4. Select **Update** and wait until it finishes. 

---

## Copy Settings to Other Displays
You can copy one display's settings, including Wi-Fi, the OptiSigns app and time zone, to other displays with a USB drive. This saves time when you set up many displays.

 
1. Insert a USB drive into the display you've already set up. 
2. Press the settings (gear) button on the remote, then go to **EZ Setting** > **Setting Data Cloning**. 
3. Select **Export Setting Data**. 
4. Insert the USB drive into each of the other displays, go to the same menu, and select **Import Setting Data**.
