With the Vimeo app, it's possible to play any Vimeo video on your digital signs. Paste the video's link into OptiSigns and it's ready to go on a screen, in a playlist or on a schedule. This article also covers how to play a video you've kept private on Vimeo, and how to show captions.

Let's get started.

## What You'll Need
 
- An OptiSigns account - ****[Standard Plan or higher](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing)  
- The link to the Vimeo video you want to display 
- An [OptiSigns-enabled device](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021855653)  
- A screen, set up and paired with OptiSigns ([see our Getting Started guide](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/18823504383891))

## Creating a Vimeo App
First, open the video you want to display on **vimeo.com**. Copy its address from your browser's address bar. The number at the end is the video's ID.

Next, go to the OptiSigns portal. Go to **Files/Assets** and select **Apps**.

Search for **Vimeo** and select the **Vimeo** app.

The Vimeo app settings will open. Fill in the following:

 
-  **Name** - The name of your Vimeo asset. This is for organizational purposes within OptiSigns only and will not display on your screens. 
-  **URL** - The Vimeo video link you copied in the first step. 

Now hit **Save**. You'll have created a Vimeo app, and it will appear in your **Files/Assets**.

## Displaying a Private Vimeo Video
You don't have to make a video public on Vimeo to play it on your screens. In the video's privacy settings on Vimeo:

 
1. Under **Link**, select **Hide from Vimeo**. 
2. Under **Embed**, set **Where can the video be embedded?** to **Specific domains** and add **social-player.optisigns.com**. 

The video stays hidden on Vimeo, but your OptiSigns screens can still play it. Then create and deploy the Vimeo app as normal.

## Displaying Vimeo Videos with Captions
The Vimeo app doesn't have a captions setting. To show captions, use the **Streaming App** with a Vimeo player link that turns them on.

First, build the link from your video's ID (the number at the end of its vimeo.com link):

 
-  **Captions you uploaded** - https://player.vimeo.com/video/VIDEO_ID?autoplay=1&loop=1&texttrack=en 
-  **Vimeo's auto-generated captions** - https://player.vimeo.com/video/VIDEO_ID?autoplay=1&loop=1&texttrack=en-x-autogen 
Replace **VIDEO_ID** with your video's ID. For another language, replace **en** with that language's code, as long as the video has captions in that language on Vimeo.

Next, go to **Files/Assets**, select **Apps**, then search for and select the **Streaming App**.

Give the app a **Name**, paste your link into the **URL** field, then hit **Save**.

Deploy it to your screen the same way as a Vimeo app, described in **Deploying a Vimeo App** below.

## Deploying a Vimeo App
To push your Vimeo app to a screen, go to the **Screens** tab, then click **Edit** next to the screen you want to display it on.

The **Edit Screen** pop-up will appear. Select **Asset** under **Content Type**, then hit **Change** next to **Selected Asset**.

The **Select Asset** window will open. Search for your Vimeo app, click it, then hit **Select**.

Back in **Edit Screen**, hit **Save**. Your Vimeo video will now play on your screen. This same process can be applied to a Streaming app if you're wanting to display your Vimeo video with captions.

Your Vimeo app can also be displayed in a Playlist or Schedule, or as one zone of a [Split Screen](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573).
