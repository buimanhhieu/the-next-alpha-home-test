With the Trello app, it's possible to display your Trello boards on your digital signs. Keep your team's tasks, priorities and progress in view in the office, on the shop floor or in a meeting room, and let the screen refresh itself as cards move.

Let's get started.

## What You'll Need
 
- An OptiSigns account - ****[Standard Plan or higher](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing)  
- A Trello account, with access to the board you want to display 
- An [OptiSigns-enabled device](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021855653)  
- A screen, set up and paired with OptiSigns ([see our Getting Started guide](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/18823504383891))

## Creating a Trello App
First, open the board you want to display at **trello.com**. Copy its address from your browser's address bar. It will look like:

 https://trello.com/b/boardId/board-name 

Next, go to the OptiSigns portal. Go to **Files/Assets** and select **Apps**.

Search for **Trello** and select the **Trello** app.

The Trello app settings will open. Fill in the following:

 
-  **Name** - The name of your Trello asset. This is for organizational purposes within OptiSigns only and will not display on your screens. 
-  **Type** - **URL** to show a board from its link, or **Embed** to show a single card from its embed code. You can't change this after saving.
  -  **URL** - The Trello board address you copied. Card links (https://trello.com/c/…) work too.
  
-  **Update Interval** - How often the app checks Trello for updates, measured in seconds. The default is 600 (every 10 minutes). Set it to 0 to check only when the app first loads. 
-  **Sign in with Credential** - Turn this on if your board is private. See ****[Displaying a Private Trello Board](#DisplayingAPrivateTrelloBoard) below. 

To show a single card instead of a board, set **Type** to **Embed** and paste the card's Trello embed code into **Embed Code**.

Now hit **Save**. You'll have created a Trello app, and it will appear in your **Files/Assets**.

## Displaying a Private Trello Board
If your board isn't public, OptiSigns needs to sign in to Trello to show it. 

Turn on **Sign in with Credential** and fill in the **Sign In** section:

 
-  **Username/Email** - The Trello login the screen should use. 
-  **Password** - The password for that login. 
-  **Master Password** - Optional. Check **Use master password** to add an extra layer of encryption to the saved login. If you use it, you'll need to enter the master password once in the OptiSigns app on each device.

## Deploying a Trello App
To push your Trello app to a screen, go to the **Screens** tab, then click **Edit** next to the screen you want to display it on.

The **Edit Screen** pop-up will appear. Select **Asset** under **Content Type**, then hit **Change** next to **Selected Asset**.

The **Select Asset** window will open. Search for your Trello app, click it, then hit **Select**.

Back in **Edit Screen**, hit **Save**. Your Trello board will now display on your screen.

Your Trello app can also be displayed in a Playlist or Schedule, or as one zone of a [Split Screen](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573).
