Put your intranet on the wall. SharePoint News reads the news posts already published on a Microsoft SharePoint site and displays them on your screens, refreshing on its own as your team publishes.

## What you'll need
 
- An OptiSigns account on the ****[Standard plan or above](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing). 
- A Microsoft SharePoint site with news posts on it 
- The **site URL**, in the form `https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite`  
-  **Service Principal method only:** An **Azure Service Principal** saved (or ability to be created) in OptiSigns, and administrator access to the Azure Portal to grant it permission to read SharePoint 

---

## Which connection method to use
SharePoint News offers two ways to connect, and you choose between them in the app itself under **Choose Authentication Method**.

 
-  **Direct Login Method** - This connects you through a single person's Microsoft Account. This is best for getting started quickly, or a single SharePoint site that one person owns. 
-  **Service Principal Method** - This connects you through a Service Principal, which is an application belonging to a larger organization. This is best for anything long-lived or needing security permissions, and allows your site to keep working even if staff change roles, change passwords, or leave. 

---

## How it works
OptiSigns reads your SharePoint site through the Microsoft Graph API. With a Service Principal, it connects as a dedicated application identity in your Microsoft tenant rather than as any one person's account. With Direct Login, it connects as the person who signed in.

The permissions involved are **read-only** in both cases. OptiSigns never writes to SharePoint, never posts, and never changes a file. It just lets you display them on your digital signs.

---

## Setting Up the App
In OptiSigns, go to **Files/Assets**, select **Apps**:

Choose **SharePoint News**.

Give the news wall a **Name**, then paste the **SharePoint Site URL**. It must be the address of the site itself, not of a page or a post inside it:

https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite

To find it, open the site in your browser and copy the address up to and including the site name, discarding anything after it.

Under **Choose Authentication Method**, pick **Direct Login** or **Use Service Principal**.

### If you chose Direct Login
Select **Sign in with Microsoft** and complete the Microsoft sign-in. Once connected, the button changes to **Authorized with Microsoft as **.

The news wall then reads SharePoint as that person. It keeps working until that account's password or sign-in policy changes, at which point the app asks you to reconnect.

Skip to **Test the connection**.

### If you chose Use Service Principal

## (Optional) Set up a Service Principal, or reuse one you have
A Service Principal is an Azure app registration saved to your OptiSigns account. 

To create one:

 
- Copy its **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID.**  
- Create a client secret 
- Save it in OptiSigns under **Settings → Integrations → Power BI → Add Azure Service Principal**  
This is the same for any OptiSigns Service Principal integration. See [How to Set Up a Power BI Service Principal for Use in OptiSigns](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/32860569148819-How-to-Set-Up-a-Power-BI-Service-Principal-for-Use-in-OptiSigns) for more.

Follow the sections **Create an Entra App in Microsoft Azure** and **Authenticating OptiSigns via Service Principal** in that article, then return here.

Next, give that Service Principal permission to read SharePoint.

In the **Azure Portal**, open your app registration, go to **API permissions**, select **Add a permission**, choose **Microsoft Graph**, then **Application permissions**.

Add either of these, depending on what your organization's policy allows:

Still on **API permissions**, select **Grant admin consent for <your organization>**. The **Status** column must read **Granted** before the connection will work.

Now pick your Service Principal from **Select the Service Principal Integration**.

---

## Test the connection
Select **Test Connection**, beside the **SharePoint Site URL** field. A green tick on the button means OptiSigns reached the site and could read its posts; a warning triangle means it could not. Resolve any error before saving — the messages are listed under **Troubleshooting**.

**Save**, then add the news wall to a playlist or assign it to a screen as you would any other app.

---

## Appearance settings
Open the **Appearance** section of the configuration dialog.

 
-  **Display Mode **- Choose your display mode. Decide between Default, Single Post, or Modern layout. 
-  **Theme **- Choose between Light, Dark, or Custom themes. Choosing Custom will add numerous options that let you change the colors on your theme. 
-  **Font Size **- Choose your Font Size. Default is 20, Custom lets you choose.

 

  
-  **Show QR Code **- When checked, will show a QR code linking to the full post on SharePoint. 
-  **Show Banner Image **- When checked, will show each post's banner image. 
-  **Company Logo **- Lets you upload your company logo to be shown alongside each post. 

---

## Post settings
Open the **Post Settings** section.

 
-  **Number of Posts **- Choose how many total posts the asset will cycle through. 
-  **Max Age of Posts **- Choose how old the posts that can display will be. 
-  **Post Duration **- Shows how long each post will stay on the screen before cycling to another post. 
Under **Advanced**, **Refresh Interval** sets how often OptiSigns checks SharePoint for new posts, in seconds (default 3600 — once an hour).

## Troubleshooting and FAQs
Here, we'll go over error messages you might receive when trying to set up SharePoint on OptiSigns. What they mean, and how to solve them.

#### "Connected — no posts yet; new ones appear automatically."
The connection works, but the site has no news posts. Publish one in SharePoint and it will appear on the next refresh.

#### "Connected — all N posts are older than the 30-day Max Age; none will show. Raise Max Age of Posts."
The connection works, but every post is older than the **Max Age of Posts** setting. Raise it under **Post Settings**. On the screen itself this shows as "No SharePoint posts from the last 30 days are currently available."

#### "Connected — news list unavailable right now; it retries automatically."
A temporary SharePoint problem. No action needed.

#### "The Service Principal authenticated, but does not have access to that site. Ask your Microsoft admin to grant it access to this specific SharePoint site."
The application identity is valid but was never granted access to this particular site. This is the expected result of using `Sites.Selected` without also granting site access. Make sure your admin account within Azure has access to the requested SharePoint site.

#### "This Microsoft account does not have access to that SharePoint site."
The Direct Login equivalent of the message above. Sign in with an account that can open the site.

#### "An administrator has not granted this app permission to read SharePoint. Ask your Microsoft admin to grant consent."
Admin consent has not been completed. In Azure, open **API permissions**, select **Grant admin consent**, and confirm the **Status** column reads **Granted**.

#### "This app is not authorised in your Microsoft tenant. Ask your Microsoft admin to grant consent."
Same cause as above. The application has not been consented for your organization.

#### "That SharePoint site could not be found. Check the URL — it should look like https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite"
Check the URL. A link to a page or a post inside the site will not work.

#### "The Service Principal client secret is incorrect. Check the secret VALUE (not the secret ID) in the Integrations page."
Check that you entered the secret **Value** and not the **Secret ID**. If you no longer have the Value, create a new secret in Azure and update the integration.

#### "The Service Principal client secret has expired. Create a new secret in Azure and update the integration."
Azure client secrets expire on the date set when they were created. This means you need to refresh your client secret within the Service Principal.

#### "The Service Principal application was not found in this Microsoft tenant. Check the Client ID and Tenant ID."
Check both against the app registration's overview page in Azure.

#### "The Microsoft tenant ID is not valid. Check the Tenant ID in the Integrations page."
Check the **Tenant ID** on the integration.

#### "The Microsoft sign-in for this app has expired. Please reconnect the Microsoft account."
A Direct Login connection has lapsed. Microsoft refresh tokens expire after about 90 days idle, or sooner if the password or sign-in policy changed. Open the app and sign in again.

#### "Microsoft now requires multi-factor authentication for this account. Please reconnect the Microsoft account."
Your organization enabled MFA for the signed-in account. Reconnect it, or switch this news wall to a Service Principal, which is not subject to interactive MFA.

#### "Microsoft is rate-limiting requests for this tenant. This usually clears on its own."
This means that too many requests have been sent to the Microsoft tenant recently, and it is being overloaded. No action needed.
