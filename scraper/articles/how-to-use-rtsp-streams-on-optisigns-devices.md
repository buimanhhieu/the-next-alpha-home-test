Show a live feed from an IP camera on your digital signs. The RTSP Stream app plays any RTSP stream, and once you've added it you can put it on as many screens as you like.

How you set it up depends on the device that plays it:

 
-  **Android and Fire TV devices** - Play RTSP streams directly. You only need to add the RTSP Stream app. 
-  **Windows and Raspberry Pi** - Can't play RTSP directly, so the stream is first converted to HTTP with VLC Media Player.

## What You'll Need
 
- The RTSP URL of your camera or stream 
- An OptiSigns device on the same network as the camera 
- For Windows or Raspberry Pi: OptiSigns player version 5.3.2 or newer - [download the latest version](https://www.optisigns.com/download) - and a computer on the same network that can run [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

## Add the RTSP Stream App
Sign in to [app.optisigns.com](https://app.optisigns.com), go to **Files/Assets** and click **Apps**. Search for **RTSP** and click **RTSP Stream**.

Fill in the RTSP Stream settings:

 
-  **Name** - The name you'll see in your asset list. It is not shown on your screens. 
-  **URL** - The RTSP URL of your stream, for example `rtsp://username:password@192.168.1.20:554/stream1`. The exact format depends on your camera; check its manual. 

Click **Save**. Your RTSP Stream is now an asset you can assign to screens, or add to a Playlist or Schedule. To change it later, click it in **Files/Assets**.

## Show an RTSP Stream on Windows or Raspberry Pi

Windows and Raspberry Pi players can't play RTSP directly. Instead, VLC Media Player on a computer on your network converts the RTSP stream to an HTTP stream, and OptiSigns plays that.

### Convert the Stream in VLC
Open VLC Media Player, go to **Media** and click **Open Network Stream**.

On the **Network** tab, type your RTSP URL in **Please enter a network URL**.

Click the arrow next to **Play** and select **Stream**.

Click **Next**.

In **New destination**, select **HTTP** and click **Add**.

Type **9999** in **Port** and **/stream.ogv** in **Path**, then click **Next**. Your stream will be available at `http://<the computer's IP address>:9999/stream.ogv`.

Under **Profile**, select **Video - Theora + Vorbis (OGG)** and click **Next**.

Check **Generated stream output string**: it must contain **vcodec=theo** and **mux=ogg**. Change it by hand if it doesn't. Then click **Stream**.

VLC starts converting. The progress bar moves while it streams.

### Add the Stream to OptiSigns
Add the RTSP Stream app as described in [Add the RTSP Stream App](#AddTheRTSPStreamApp). In **URL**, enter the HTTP address from VLC, `http://<the computer's IP address>:9999/stream.ogv`, instead of the RTSP URL.

Click **Save**, then assign the RTSP Stream to your Windows or Raspberry Pi screen.

## Troubleshooting
Here are a few common issues our customers run into when using the RTSP app, and how to solve them.

#### The Stream Stays Black on an Android or Fire TV Device
Check that the RTSP URL plays in VLC on a computer on the same network. If it doesn't play there, the URL, the username and password, or the camera's network settings are wrong.

#### The Stream Doesn't Play on Windows or Raspberry Pi
Check that VLC is still running and streaming on the computer, that you entered the HTTP address rather than the RTSP URL, and that the player is version 5.3.2 or newer.

#### The Stream Plays in VLC but Not on the Screen
Check that the signage device is on the same network as the camera, or as the computer running VLC, and that no firewall blocks port 9999 on that computer.
