**Source:** https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/4529298306963-How-to-Use-Microsoft-Excel-Online-with-OptiSigns

Microsoft Excel is a very popular way to create and share your spreadsheet. You can also use it on your Digital Signage screen.

There are 2 ways to use Excel with OptiSigns:

1) Upload the XLSX file, and OptiSigns will convert and display on your screen (pros: can play offline, just upload files, cons: when there are changes, you need to upload the files again)

2) Use Excel for Web (online) (pros: **you can make changes to the Excel file and screens will update automatically**, cons: need internet connection to display)

 

This article will walk you through how to set up option 2:

Upload your Excel to OneDrive and changes to your Excel can be automatically updated on your screens.

If this is your first time using OptiSigns, you can [read here](https://www.optisigns.com/blog/how-to-set-up-digital-signs-with-optisigns-and-amazon-fire-tv) to get set up.

Otherwise, let's dive in.

****
## 1) Create and prepare your Excel
First, we need to make sure your spreadsheet will fit on a single page. To do this, go to the **Page Layout **tab, then locate the **Scale to Fit **area. Here, for the **Width**, keep it to **1 page**, then set **Height **to **however large your spreadsheet is**.

Then upload your Excel file to your Microsoft OneDrive. If you're using the Web version of Excel, you can skip this step.

Then on the **File** tab of the Ribbon, click **Share. **Make sure the Link Settings are set to **Anyone**:

 Now click **Share **again, then click **Embed**.

To create the HTML code to embed your file in the web page, click **Generate.**

Under **Embed Code**, right-click the code, click **Copy**, and then click **Close**.

### That's all!
You have created an Excel Online.
Anytime changes are made to the Excel Online workbook, the screens will be updated by the update intervals.

### Why does using Excel require giving OptiSigns Admin permission to use?
OptiSigns uses Microsoft APIs for integration. In order for our integrations to work, the integration has to be approved by an administrator. This is the same across all integrations using Microsoft APIs.

This administrator access is only needed for first time access. Once the OptiSigns app is approved for use, other users can use OptiSigns directly.
